Elite - The New Kind   Release 1.0
--------------------   -----------

Revision date: 22 July 2001

This is release 1.0 of Elite - The New Kind.
For changes since previous releases see below.

newkindb.zip contains a compiled version of the code designed to run under MS Windows 95/98/NT using the Allegro graphics library and DirectX.

newkind.zip contains source code for Elite - The New Kind.
If you want to recompile the game then please note the following...
a. The .wav and .dat files are not included in the source distribution to keep the size down, they can be found in newkindb.zip.
b. You need the WIP version of Allegro to compile the code.

The latest versions of the source and executable can always be found on the New Kind website...
http://www.newkind.co.uk

To run the supplied executable you will need DirectX installed.  Windows 98/ME/2000 and NT 4 (with latest service pack) come with this.
If you are using Windows 95 and you haven't already installed DirectX you will need to do so.
The DirectX runtime can be downloaded from the Microsoft website. (www.microsoft.com/directx).

Two pieces of music are included in Elite - The New Kind.  The Elite Theme and The Blue Danube.
The Elite Theme was composed by Aidan Bell and the Blue Danube was composed by Strauss.
I spent a long time hunting for the best MIDI versions of these pieces I could find.
To appreciate them properly you will need a decent Soft Synth Midi driver installed and set as you prefered Midi and Sound device.
